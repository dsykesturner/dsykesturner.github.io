					<h3 class="minor">What am I</h3>
					<p>I am a developer, a drone enthusiast, a motorbike rider, and a coffee snob.</p>
					<p><b>Hi, I'm Daniel</b></p>
					<p>I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student at Monash University.</br>I currently work at <a href="https://localz.com" target="_blank">Localz</a> as a Software Engineer, and have previously done work at <a href="https://www.livetiles.nyc" target="_blank">LiveTiles</a> and <a href="https://cyara.com" target="_blank">Cyara.</a></p>

					<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/work-coffee.jpeg" alt="Work Coffee Photo" /></span>
					<h3 class="minor">Localz</h3>
					<p>For 8 hours a day I call a trendy start-up office in Melbourne CBD home. It has bean bags, games, and all the Melbourne coffee nearby you need (actually there can always be more).</br>This is the office of <a href="https://localz.com" target="_blank">Localz.</a></p>
					<p>As part of my activities I build enterprise native iOS and mixed platform (React Native) apps and SDKs. I also enjoy side projects dawbling in NodeJS such as our timesheet slackbot, OptimusTime.
					<br/>If you'd like to build your own SDKs, you must first collect some coffee and unicorn tears (tears of joy). Check out one of the final products on Github here: <a href="https://github.com/localz/Spotz3-iOS-SDK" target="_blank">SpotzSDK</a></p>

					<h2 class="minor">2014</h2>
					<h3 class="minor">December - Won Nab iDAY Hackathon with Medipass</h3>
					<p>Attended and won my first hackathon with a team from Localz with the idea of a mobile payment solution that supported booking, payment, and health insurance deductions from within the app. This idea went on to become Medipass Solutions Pty Ltd.</p>
					<h3 class="minor">March - Bachelor of Software Engineering at Monash University</h3>
					<p>I excitedly began my 4 year course of Software Engineering. Some of you may ask "what exactly is software engineering?" Well it's fairly similar to the 3 year computer science course, but splits off half way with a further focus on project management and high level software project architecture to ensure the project actually succeeds.</p>
					<h3 class="minor">February - Joined Localz as a Software Engineer</h3>
					<p>Localz is a micro-location (iBeacon, GPS, etc) software company offering two services - LastMile Delivery and LastMile Click&Collect.
					<br/><br/>I work on mobile development, building apps and development kits that package up core logic for other companies to quickly implement.</p>
					
					<h2 class="minor">2013</h2>
					<h3 class="minor">November - Graduated Highschool</h3>
					<p>Graduating from St Leonard's College in Brighton, Australia, I excelled in IT, Physics, Maths, and various personal projects I managed to relate to school.</p>
					
					<h2 class="minor">2011</h2>
					<h3 class="minor">April - Founded Universe Apps</h3>
					<p>I created a sole ownership company to distribute my apps on Apple's App Store. To date I have accumulated over 500k downloads.</p>
					
					<h2 class="minor">2009</h2>
					<h3 class="minor">October - Began Programming on iOS</h3>
					<p>I started programming on iOS after realising the lack of entertaining games available for download. Code very quickly drew my attention as I realised its unbounded limitations, and incredible availability from an iPod Touch in my pocket.</p>
